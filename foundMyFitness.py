# Sample noteworthy genetic variants collected from various Found My Fitness
# reports. This data is compiled from multiple reports that have flagged these
# varients as noteworthy. Your mileage may vary.
#
# Note some SNPs have two variant combinations of interest. In that case, the
# second variant SNP starts with a '*' so that it represents a unique key in
# the disctionary structure. This '*' character will need to be stripped off
# by the program doing the analysis.
#
# Also Note: 23andMe reports all SNPs from the plus orientation.
# In the scientific literature, some are actually supposed to be reported from
# the opposite strand. Remember that A pairs with T and G with C. For these
# handful of SNPs that are reported from the opposite strand, FoundMyFitness
# makes the correction and effectively invert the letters... this is to
# correspond to the published science rather than 23andMe's
# arbitrary decision to differ in its reporting style.
#
# Per Found My Fitness, these results are NOT FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES and are subject
# to change. Raw data from genetic providers is suitable only for research,
# educational providers is suitable only for research, educational, and
# informational use and not for medical or other use.
